# Work-Day-Scheduler
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events

## Description

- This project tests my ability to work with Jquery and local storage.
- I was provided with an html file and styling
- This project helped me learn to simplify using local storage with jquery and build functionality
- I learned how  adding and looping through many keys in local storage is actually easier than using one large object.

### User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

### Acceptance Criteria

*Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.
*Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
*Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
*Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
*Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
*Persist events between refreshes of a page.

* The final code should show a working 9-5 day on a webpage, showing times, a text entry box and a save button against each textbox so the data can be saved to local browser storage. The finished page should match the following GIF image:![Layout of finished page](./assets/images/05-third-party-apis-homework-demo.gif)

The starting, non-functioning code and styled layout is provided by EdX
Thanks to tutor Navpreet Ahuja who helped me simplify the code and better understand the minimum requirements. Navpreet explained why building the framework in HTML was less complicated than building a starter object.
